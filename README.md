## Ising model phase transition with CNN

This is a short notebook to reproduce some results from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01735.pdf).

More details are in the python notebook, but in brief, 2D Ising model spin configurations are generated by 
Monte Carlo and then used to train a convolutional neural network. The CNN is trained only on configurations 
deep within the ordered and disordered phases (very high and very low temperatures states). It is then tested 
on configurations across a range of temperatures including near the critical regime. The CNN can classify a given 
spin configuration as belonging to the ordered or disordered phase and predicts an accurate critical temperature.


### Instructions
* Fairly common dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, scikit, scipy, keras, tqdm
* For keras, there are a few lines that assume tensorflow as the backend, but they are easily modified
* Clone and run with something like `jupyter notebook`
